Python
======

Powerful programming language, well-maintained by development team with frequent updates. Check out the [documentation](https://www.python.org/).
* Versatile! Can be used as a simple calculator, to organize and manipulate data structures, visualize data, for machine learning, and even manipulate MRI data.
* Macs come pre-installed with python 2.7 but most packages you use will likely require python 3 and above.
* To take advantage of the robustness of python, recommend installing libraries.
    * Library = package that uses python to perform pre-set functions
* Some libraries are built upon others--they add functionality to already existing functions.

## **Installation**

---------------------------------

Python Libraries for Data Science  
=================================

**Data Organization & Processing**
* Pandas: essential for organization/manipulation/plotting of series data (single column), and data frames (two-dimensional, table with multiple columns)
    * Deal with missing data (e.g., impute)
	* Add/delete columns 
    * Plot data with histogram or plot box
* NumPy: Numerical Python: perform operations on arrays and matrices (i.e., column of values)
* SciPy: includes modules for linear algebra, integration, optimization, and statistics
    * Built upon NumPy
* Statsmodels: computation of descriptive statistics, estimation and inference for statistical models.  

**Data Visualization**
* Matplotlib: plotting aka making pretty figures (think making attention-grabbing figures like line graphs, scatterplots, histograms) 
    * Gives great competition to pricey MATLAB
* Seaborn: extends Matplotlib for making figures to visualize statistical models
    * Think correlation matrices, connectivity matrices, distributions) 
* Plotly: web-based tool; graph plotting library
    * Think creating and displaying figures, updating figures, hovering over text for details 
    * Basic charts, violin plots, maps, subplots (think multi-component figure)
* Bokeh: for interactive and scalable visualizations through web-browsers (aka awesome presentations).  

**Machine Learning/AI**
* Scikit-Learn: group of packages in the SciPy stack
    * Machine learning and data mining. Think classification, clustering, regression, dimensionality reduction, model selection) 
        * Support vector machine, random forests, k-means clustering, spectral clustering, mean shift, cross-validation)
* TensorFlow: for machine learning + deep learning, artificial intelligence library for creating large-scale neural networks
    * Good for handling multiple data sets
    * Deep learning models and deploying ML-powered applications
* Keras: neural network library
    * TensorFlowâ€™s high-level API for building and training Deep Neural Network code
    * Statistical modeling but with images + text
    * Think linear regression, correlation, OLS, GLM (what you might do in SPSS).
