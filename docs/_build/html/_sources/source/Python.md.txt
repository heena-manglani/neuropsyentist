Python
======

Powerful programming language, well-maintained by development team. Check out the [Python documentation](https://www.python.org/).
* Versatile! Can be used as a simple calculator, to organize and manipulate data structures, visualize data, for machine learning, and even manipulate MRI data.
* Macs come pre-installed with python 2.7 but most packages will likely require python 3(+).
* To take advantage of the robustness of python, recommend installing libraries.
    * Library = package that uses python to perform pre-set functions
* Some libraries are built upon others--they add functionality to already existing functions.

## **Installation**
To install the latest version of Python, go to the [Python for Mac](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/), download the macOS 64-bit installer, and follow prompts.

Python Libraries for Data Science  
---------------------------------

Data Organization & Processing
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): organize, manipulate, plot single column series data, and data frames tables
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/): short for Numerical Python, perform operations on arrays and matrices
* [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/): conduct linear algebra, integration, optimization, and statistics

Data Visualization
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): plotting, making pretty figures (line graphs, scatterplots, histograms) 
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/): extends Matplotlib for making figures to visualize statistical tests and models (correlation matrices, connectivity matrices, distributions)
* [Plotly](https://plotly.com/): web-based tool; graph plotting library for creating and displaying figures, hovering over to show details.
* [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/index.html): for interactive and scalable visualizations through web-browsers (aka cool presentations).  

Machine Learning/AI
* [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): group of packages in the SciPy stack
    * Machine learning and data mining. Think classification, clustering, regression, dimensionality reduction, model selection.
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/): artificial intelligence library for creating large-scale neural networks (machine learning + deep learning) 
* [Keras](https://keras.io/): neural network library
    * TensorFlowâ€™s high-level API for building and training Deep Neural Network code
    * Statistical modeling but with images + text
    * Think linear regression, correlation, OLS, GLM (what you might do in SPSS).
