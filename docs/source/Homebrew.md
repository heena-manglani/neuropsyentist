Homebrew
========

Homebrew is a package manager tool for macOS and Linux.

## **Installation**
Command:  
```/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"```
* Documentation can be found here: https://brew.sh/

## **Need to Know**
Homebrew is installed in /usr/local. This means that every time we open up terminal it will have access to our /usr/local/bin directory.  
Install packages using “brew” will install packages in their own direction and then symlink it into /usr/local. 

## **Upgrade**
Command:  
`Brew upgrade`
