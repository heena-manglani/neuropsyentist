VScode
======

Visual Studio Code is an open-source code editor from Microsoft, available on Mac, Linux, and Windows. VS code comes with many tools for free- an integrated terminal, Intellisense (code completion), and Git integrations to name a few. One of the biggest strengths of vs code is the use of extensions. This transforms it into powerhouse that can add multiple languages, debuggers,and other tools. You can also customize the theme to fit you perfectly.
